#### _Miscreated Lua Completions_

This Document describes basic usage / setup of Lua Completions for Miscreated.
MisLuaCompletions is designed for use with VSCode and the `sumneko.lua` plugin.

These Completions are a Work in Progress. they are currently Incomplete and may not be entirely accurate in some places as they are based
on a combination of the ScriptBind listing made available to Modders at:  [HendrikP/MisScriptBinds](https://github.com/hendrikp/MisScriptBinds)
and then updated/converted by hand. using the information available over at [CE3: ScripBind Reference](https://docs.cryengine.com/display/CEPROG/ScriptBind+Reference)
but should be close enough / complete  enough for general usage, and will be improved over time...
